// For each trading period an upward change U or downward change D is calculated. Up periods are characterized by the close being higher than the previous close:
// U = close_now - close_previous
// D = 0

// Conversely, a down period is characterized by the close being lower than the previous period's close (note that D is nonetheless a positive number),
// U = 0
// D = close_previous - close_now

// If the last close is the same as the previous, both U and D are zero. 
// The average U and D are calculated using an n-period smoothed or modified moving average (SMMA or MMA) which is an exponentially smoothed Moving Average with Î± = 1/period. Some commercial packages, like AIQ, use a standard exponential moving average (EMA) as the average instead of Wilder's SMMA.

// Wilder originally formulated the calculation of the moving average as: 
// newval = (prevval * (period - 1) + newdata) / period. 
// This is fully equivalent to the aforementioned exponential smoothing. New data is simply divided by period which is equal to the alpha calculated value of 1/period. Previous average values are modified by (period -1)/period which in effect is period/period - 1/period and finally 1 - 1/period which is 1 - alpha.

// The ratio of these averages is the relative strength or relative strength factor:
// RS = SMMA(U,n) / SMMA(D,n)
// If the average of D values is zero, then according to the equation, the RS value will approach infinity, so that the resulting RSI, as computed below, will approach 100.

// The relative strength factor is then converted to a relative strength index between 0 and 100:[1]
// RSI = 100 - 100 / (1+RS)
// The smoothed moving averages should be appropriately initialized with a simple moving average using the first n values in the p
